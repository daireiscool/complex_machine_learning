# Complex Machine Learning

Notebook to explore how machione learning models change if their coefficients are complex.  

#### Models:
* Linear Regression/ Classification
* Logestic Classification
* Neural Network

#### Issues:
* Gradient Descent does not work (use steps of epsilon?)
* Unless result is imaginary, will have to get the norm of the outputted value
* Use cases?
